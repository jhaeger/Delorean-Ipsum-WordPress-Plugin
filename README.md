# Delorean-Ipsum-WordPress-Plugin
This is a plugin to add Delorean ipsum dummy text to a WordPress site using a shortcode. This is not for displaying a them, but for having content to design for and around for new sites, or child themes. 

Currently, you have to manually create a span with a class of delorean-p. More options and shortcode coming soon.

Replace -p with the element you want it to be. includes h1-h4 and blockquote (for now).
